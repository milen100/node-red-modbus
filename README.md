# node-red-modbus
Modbus protocol support for node-red

Note: this is a place holder.  We are looking for assitance to complete this project.

Overview:

- Create 3 node-red compatible nodes:  modbus-in; modbus-out; modbus-config.
- Follow node-red coding convetions
- See examples here: https://github.com/node-red/node-red/tree/master/nodes/core/io
- Use modbus node: https://www.npmjs.com/package/modbus for protocol stack
